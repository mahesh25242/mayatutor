    q: 'What are the ROBOTIC RECORDED CLASSES or OFFLINE CLASSES ? How can this be executed on this webportal mayatutors.com?',
    ans: '<b class="text-dark">Ans:</b> In this way, the teachers record the classes of each day as a video and then convert it into individual courses, giving the students the opportunity to study at their convenience. Teachers are encouraged and instructed by the recorded class on this web portal. <p>The advantage of this is that teachers do not have to spend special time for students.</p> <p>A thousand students from different classes, even if they come to class at the same time, can teach together. When new students arrive, teachers can take classes by giving videos of previously taken classes without taking a new one. In addition, students can attend classes at any time. In all classes, students can be given all the recorded subjects at the same time. You can also earn a good income.</p>'

  {
    q: `How to take classes of school, college, dance or music this way as recorded    classes?`,
    ans: `<b class="text-dark">Ans:</b> Let's see how to teach. Imagine you are a teacher who takes a science subject in 10th standard, in the beginning of a new academic year, some students would approach you for science tuition. Now you record the video of you taking tuition of the first lesson of the science subject in a camera or mobile. This way, all classes taking each day for newly arrived students should be recorded as videos and kept.
          <p>Name the first video "FIRST DAY SCIENCE CLASS '', name the video of the class taken second day "SECOND DAY SCIENCE CLASS ''. this way,  if you are taking 250 classes a year, there would be 250 videos. Then upload each of these videos on youtube or google drive or vimeo as UNLISTED.</p>
          <p>Thus, Make the first 30 days classes as a  course called "FIRST MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" on mayatutors.com, then the first 30 video classes should be listed as 30 Classes in order.</p>
          <p>Next, second month's classes (31 to 60 days video), create a new course named "SECOND MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" and list the 31 to 60 video 30 Classes in it in order.</p>
          <p>Next, third month videos (61 to 90 days video), create another course named "THIRD MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" and list the 61 to 90 video 30 Classes in it in order.</p>
          <p>By doing so, in the second month, if some new students are approaching for science tuition, the course "FIRST MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" can be opened and given to the new students and receive one month's fees. When the new students complete their first course, after receiving next month's fees, you can give the second course "SECOND MONTH SCIENCE TUITION". that is, 31 to 60 days' videos.</p>
          <p>suppose that there will be 250 video classes that you take science tuition each day for that year. Of these, first 30 videos should be in the course "FIRST MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" and The second 30 videos should be in the course "SECOND MONTH SCIENCE TUITION" and the third 30 videos should be in the course "THIRD MONTH SCIENCE TUITION". The rest of the classes should be listed as next courses which contain 30 videos each. Like this, each course should be given to each student by accepting each month's fees. </p>
          <p>If you want to receive fees for every three months (every semester) instead of receiving every month fees, you have to create a course named "FIRST SEMESTER SCIENCE TUITION"/ "FIRST QUARTERLY SCIENCE TUITION". in which do list your first three months video classes (1 to 90 video) orderly. Now, you can give students their first semester course by receiving first semester fees.</p>
          <p>same way create a course "SECOND SEMESTER SCIENCE TUITION" and list the next three month's videos(91 to 180 video) in order. This course can be given as second semester to the students who have completed the first semester.</p>
          <p>while you list videos (Classes) of each day's classes, if needed, a pdf (note) also can be listed. Students have the option to download WORD or EXCEL also.</p>
          <p>The same way, dance, music, collage, school, drawing, etc. also can be listed in order. school college video classes, can be used for next years also unless the syllabus does not change. For those who conduct other classes like dance, music, drawing etc. their once recorded videos can be used for years. while students study at their convenience, teachers can find time for other jobs.</p>`

    q: `What are the advantages of a robotic recorded class?`,
    ans: `<b class="text-dark">Ans:</b> The first advantage is that multiple students can be taught multiple subjects or courses at the same time. Example: Students in grades 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 can teach science, history, politics, and biology at the same time.</p>
    <p>For this you need to create an eighth grade science course. If you charge a monthly tuition fee you will need to create 12 science courses.</p>
    <p>Similarly, each subject in each standard needs to be created into 12 classes. Any subsequent student can take the respective course for the first month.</p>
    <p>This is the second achievement. Once the recorded classes are listed, there is no need to take tuition later. If the syllabus does not change next year, these classes can be used.</p>`

Create a course called Live Class and paste the live Youtube video link inside this course. The teacher comes online at the right time and takes class online. Students who have paid the teacher's fee can attend this live class. This live video will be available until the live link teacher removes it from this course.
