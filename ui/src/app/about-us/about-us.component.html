        <p>Over the past nine years, (since 2013) Maya have been successful in making teacher's work easier and giving opportunities to students to study independently. When the whole world was suddenly struck by the covid pandemic, we managed to successfully run one year's full courses in "ROBOTIC" method without teachers. In fact it was a "face to face" virtual class. in which no matter how many students come to class at the same time, there will be a teacher in front of them on various subjects.</p>
<p>When this method of study is successful, we modified this website with the intention that ordinary tution teachers also should get this facility especially in this time of covid pandemic. In this age where education is falling into the hands of monopolies, talented teachers will have to build their own websites at huge cost to avoid losing their jobs. This web portal is for such teachers to use as  their own website.</p>
  <p>So, whatever your knowledge, you can use this portal to impart that knowledge to all students. </p>
  <p>Maya is legally and officially known as the MAYA TAX ACCOUNTING TRAINING CENTER.</p>
